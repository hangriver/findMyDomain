1. Introduction
The management of a production system (goods and services) demands reliable tools to help the routine of making decisions with the
purpose of satisfying customers, minimizing costs and making a profit
contribution while maintaining competitiveness (Salam & Khan, 2016).
Discrete Simulation-Based Optimization (DSBO) is a set of tools and
methods commonly used to help researchers and practitioners, regarding analysis and decision making, for investment and resource allocation in new or already existing systems. DSBO evaluates a specific
solution space in order to find the best setting that will help to improve
key performance indicators (e.g. service level, delivery lead times,
average lateness) in favor to product quality (Gansterer, Almeder, &
Hartl, 2014; Merkuryeva & Bolshakov, 2014; Merkuryeva, Merkuryev,
& Vanmaele, 2010).
The use of DSBO for stochastic NP-hard problems demands sophisticated methods and for it, knowledge in specific areas of operations
research such as computational modeling and heuristics/metaheuristics
optimization algorithms (Laroque, Klaas, Fischer, & Kuntze, 2012).
Many articles published in this area refers to the solution of the specific
problem by one or more methods. Ahmad, Subramaniam, Othman, and
Zulkarnain (2011) studied the real-time scheduling problem using DES.
Dahal, Galloway, Burt, McDonald, and Hopkins (2005) applied a genetic algorithm to the bulk material port handling. Gourgand,
Grangeon, and Norre (2003) tested scheduling problems in m machine
stochastic flow shop with unlimited buffer. Li, Jia, and Wang (2012)
used DES with the multiple-comparison procedure to define the best
average project duration. Moengin, Septiani, and Herviana (2014) optimized the number of hospital beds using DES. With the aforementioned studies, it is possible to infer the full range of possible problems
related to the production of goods and services and its variances inside
the same problem and why the need for such different methodologies.
Considering DSBO characteristics, related Literature Reviews (LR)
from 1991 to 2016 only refers to methods applied on specific cases
related to a defined situation and a restrict number of methods, i.e.,
none of them refers to the industrial sector (manufacturing/service) in a
broad way, to help in the early stages of the optimization process. The
purpose of this work is to use the systematic literature review (SLR)
methodology, answering the research questions, to present the findings
and generate a set of discussion that can help practitioners and researchers to overview the most used DSBO techniques and contribute
with their projects on industrial engineering. As a result, can help with
the planning for the knowledge that should be managed, created and
considered in such type of project
To accomplish the purpose of the research, four steps were developed related to (1) specify and apply a research methodology combining CIMO and SLR to study DSBO, that can be a reference to future
works; (2) create an up-to-date reference set that relates industrial
engineering problems and the solutions tried to resolve using DSBO; (3)
answer the CIMO-logic research questions; and (4) introduce future
work directions pointed out by the articles.
The defined CIMO-logic questions are (A) Which are the main
problems studied, related to the area of Industrial Engineering? (B)
Which optimization and implementation software methods were the
most used? (C) How were the results measured? (D) Which author,
university, publication year and journal were found that compose the
reference research centers? In the seek to answer these questions, the
article contributes to the theoretical development of DSBO, gathering
the work of researches in this specific area for a new methodological
classification, expanding the already existing. Besides the creation of a
classification, new perspectives are related to the creation, development, and solution of a DSBO project suggesting the already exciting
methods to be considered and analyzed.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 literature review on DSBO, Section 3 research method, Section 4 findings
and discussion, and last Section 5 conclusions and findings.
2. Literature review
2.1. Discrete simulation-based optimization: definition of terms used and
research area
The term “simulation” refers to a collection of technics to mimic a
specific behavior from a real or ideal system, using resources (time and
knowledge) to answer questions made for the studied structure when
real experiments are too costly or impossible to be performed.
Simulation can be used in a variety of fields, industries, and applications, that mainly consists of data collection, analysis with the help of
computers (Banks, Nelson, Carson, & Nicol, 2010; Kelton, Sadowski, &
Swets, 2010; Law & Kelton, 1991).
It is recommended to use simulation when the studied system involves variables with stochastic behavior, none or minimal correlation
and independent and identically distributed (IID) properties (Bianchi,
Dorigo, Gambardella, & Gutjahr, 2009). If one of those characteristics
are not met, the data should be treated, or the decision maker should
consider the use of other types of modeling and optimization techniques, such as linear and non-linear optimization.
Another simulation characteristic refers to how the entities change
during time. If it only changes at specific points in the system, it is
considered discrete (e.g., operations such as cut, weld, paint), in opposition to variables that change continuously during a period of time
(Rosser, Sommerfeld, & Tincher, 1991). Other types of modeling and
simulation are based on agents’ behaviors. In these cases, the agents are
individuals with their behavior and rules, where the modeler can specify the condition when the rules will be executed. Agents are considered like decision makers with some level of learning and adaptation
(Collier & North, 2012). For the present SLR, only studies that involve
discrete-event entities behavior were analyzed, since most of the Industrial Engineering problems evolve such kind of problem where entities are transported and modified in a specific way in defined processes.
Simulation projects often aim to answer questions related to the
optimization of specific characteristics that represent “what if” scenarios to the proposed system. Optimization is defined as the minimization or maximization or both related to a one or multi-objective
function that summarizes, in a mathematical form, the questions made
for the system. If so, different combinations of alternatives are considered viable if it satisfies all the restrictions of the problem, or unviable if at least one restriction is not satisfied. The alternative that has
the best value for the objective function is considered optimal. If the
simulation has sufficient data to represent the analyzed system, the
best-simulated solution can be inferred as optimal, and have good
chances to be implemented in a real system, performing the goal to be
an excellent tool to help decision making (Taha, 2007).
To find the optimal solution, a search space made from the combination of the possible values from the variables is evaluated. The size
of this search space can be a problem regarding the resources necessary
to perform a full search covering all the possible solutions, to find the
best one. The resources, in this case, are commonly related to the
computational power available to perform all the possible solutions that
represent a quantity of time that the decision-making person could not
have. Those types of problem are considered NP-hard (He, Liang, Liu, &
Hui, 2017; Herrmann, 2013; Nawara & Hassanein, 2013). According to
Banks (1998), Chen, Jia, and Lee (2013), Xu, Huang, Chen, and Lee
(2015) a simulation optimization problem can be formulated as stated
in Eq. (1).
max ( ) [ ( ; )], J x E L x w = x X (1)
where x is an x-dimensional vector with each position representing a
problem variable from the
X
matrix of restrictions made from the
possible values of x. As
J
cannot be calculated directly, it is an expected
function from the vector x with a random function w that gives the
stochasticity (uncertainty) to the system at each complete run. An estimator for the expected value can be obtained by the sample mean.
=
J x
N ¯( ) L x w 1 ( ; )
j
N
j
1 (2)
Using the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem
(Fu, 2002), Eq. (2) is a good estimator for the expected value of
L x w ( ; )
with the decrease of sample standard deviation when
N
. As a
result, the better solution is a consequence of a large number of simulation replications that, depending on the size of the system and the
search space, demand a computer processing power and time that can
be prohibitive.
The overall optimization techniques are developed to find a good
solution, in a reasonable quantity of time, that can pass through viable
or unviable solutions in the search space depending on the method. The
“strength” of the algorithm is measured according to the ability to scape
local optimums and find a good solution that can be very close to the
global optimal solution, in a way that the relation of spent time and
quality of solution satisfy the expectations of the decision maker.
To solve the problems bounded by the definition of Eq. (2), many
authors wrote about the subject, such as Banks (1998), Chen, Jia, and
Lee (2013), Dellino and Meloni (2015), Fu (2015) Mujica Mota & Flores
De La Mota (2017), and Pawlewski and Greenwood (2014), discussing
several optimization methods, e.g., heuristics, metaheuristics, gradientbased, surrogate models, and others, applied to discrete event simulation.
Both simulation and optimization can be applied in Industrial
Engineering (IE), an area that, according to Maynard & Hodson (2004),
is concerned to problems related with the production of goods and
services, evaluating the effects of design, installation, and improvement
of systems that integrate people, materials, and information. Salvendy
(2001) states that these problems are associated with technology, performance improvement management, management, planning, design,
and control and methods for decision-making. This paper considered
studies that applied discrete event simulation and optimization (i.e.,
DSBO studies) to problems that involve the production itself, on the
shop-floor or the related production areas of goods and services, being
considered a tool to help the decision making on the Industry 4.0 era
(Xu et al., 2016), which demand tools capable of dealing with a large
amount of data to transform on information for real-time process control.

2.2. Literature review on DSBO and correlated themes
During the research, 11 Literature Reviews were found with correlated subjects to DSBO, but none comprises a wide range of successfully
adopted methods that should be considered at the beginning of DSBO
on IE projects. This makes this paper, with the use of SLR and CIMO
(explained in Section 3.2.1), a scientific contribution for the area.
The earliest LR considered was produced in 1994, presenting multiple-comparison procedures and ranking-and-selection procedures for
discrete, and gradient-based methods, likelihood ratio method, and
frequency domain experimentation for continuous problems, applied on
(s, S) inventory system and the GI/G/1 queue problems (Fu, 1994a).
Three years later an LR identified six categories and 12 optimization
methods, but it did not associate them with the IE problem type (Carson
& Maria, 1997). The next LR was in 2004 treating only the problems
related to staff scheduling and rostering (Ernst, Jiang, Krishnamoorthy,
& Sier, 2004). In the year 2009, a survey was conducted based only on
stochastic combinatorial optimization metaheuristics (Bianchi et al.,
2009).
In 2010 an LR was developed considering only simulation applications, in business and manufacturing, and without considering the
origin of the research (Jahangirian, Eldabi, Naseer, Stergioulas, &
Young, 2010). For 2013, two LRs were conducted with the first considering the state of the art in Parallel Discrete-Event Simulation (PDES)
and the second related nine methods (for continuous and discrete
variables) describing the problem of budget allocation (Jafer, Liu, &
Wainer, 2013; Long-Fei & Le-Yuan, 2013). In the next year, an LR
considering the aspects to simulation manufacturing systems design,
operations and language/package development from 2002 to 2013,
with the present paper adding the hardware issue for the aforementioned LR screen method (Negahban & Smith, 2014). The subsequent
year other three LR were performed. The first was based in 6 categories:
ranking and selection, black-box search, meta-model based, gradientbased methods, sample path, stochastic constraints and multi-objective,
explaining each category, with four random examples in total (Xu et al.,
2015). The second studied the DSBO applied to the maintenance problem (Alrabghi & Tiwari, 2015). The third discussed some issues related
to the use of DSBO in transportation (Bierlaire, 2015). Only one paper
was found (Oliveira, Lima, & Montevechi, 2016) that used the SLR
methodology relating simulation with supply chain, but not specifically
the use of optimization techniques.
Another six articles used Reviews (R) for correlated DSBO applications, in a more specific way. In 1994 a paper evaluated discrete and
continuous variables optimization methods applied to two examples
(Fu, 1994b). In 2009 a study reviewed low-order polynomial regression
metamodeling (Kleijnen, 2009). In 2013 two papers made reviews on
the subject. The first cited seven approaches and some cases of application, without specific criteria for selection (Riley, 2013). The second
referenced simulation-based optimization techniques for maintenance
operations (Alrabghi & Tiwari, 2013). Next year, an R related some
methods applied for DSBO to build design optimization (Nguyen,
Reiter, & Rigo, 2014). In 2015 an R talked about metaheuristics applied
in simulation and stochastic combinatorial problems, and the differences about these two fields (Juan, Faulin, Grasman, Rabe, & Figueira,
2015). The last R was developed in 2017 developed and analyzed
Kriging metamodeling in simulation, with no specific application
(Kleijnen, 2017). All the aforementioned LR and R composed the base
to create the method for an SLR applied to a theme (DSBO) that is
studied over the last 25 years.
3. Research method
3.1. The chose for the SLR methodology
According to Torraco (2005), a literature review (LR) is a way to the
researcher demonstrate knowledge about a particular field of study,
concerning about vocabulary, theories, key variables, methods, and
history. As a result, the LR can help to avoid problems in all the
methodology steps such as problem definition, method selection, data
collection, and analysis, which will lead to research conclusions with
less probability to have faults or inquired to be misunderstanding how
they were obtained.
As stated by Denyer and Tranfield (2009) the Systematic Literature
Review (SLR) should not be interpreted as a LR, but a research project
that at its core use the literature to respond questions, in a way that all
the steps are well defined and can be reproduced with minimal bias,
generating a close result to the original.
According to Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (2009) health
care decisions should be taken with the use of the latest research information related to the best modern practices with the help of a
methodology that can unite all the sparse information that exist, that’s a
reason for a large number of SLR presented for this scientific area.
Discussing a parallel, the same reasons can be considered to the use of
SLR in Industrial Engineering (IE), with the benefit that, in general, IE
researches do not suffer from the problems related in Hammersley
(2001); Learmont & Harding (2006) and Morrell (2008) about the exact
intrinsic nature of this science field, that is benefited by SLR characteristics to identify, to evaluate, and to summarize the collected data.
Other modern methodologies such as data mining and machine
learning can be performed on a scientific database to search for specific
works. The automatic search for words alone demands an initial specific
knowledge of the desired terms. On a diverse and scattered bibliography with themes that progress during the time, each author uses
different ways to present methodology and keywords. The manual
search for the present study was chosen, instead of an automatic one,
since it provides direct insights on other issues not defined on the start
of the research, which contributes with the development of the research
and trends for future works.
3.2. Application of SLR methodology
Booth, Papaioannou, and Sutton (2012) refer that the word “systematic” implies that the SLR should be performed with the following
characteristics: explicit, transparent, methodical, objective, standardized, structured and reproducible. For this reason, the definition of the
review steps should be done carefully. This paper adopts the steps
presented in Oliveira et al. (2016), which are planning, searching/
screening, analysis/synthesis, and the presentation of findings.
3.2.1. Planning
In the first phase, the goal was to perform a better understanding of
the core issues related to the research itself. An exploratory search was
performed on the Web of Science and Scopus databases. After that, this
phase continued with discussions and meetings with the subject of
DSBO methods. Three professors with experience in DSBO practice and
theory, Ph.D. and M.Sc. students that research on this same field participated in these events. The meetings defined the search for articles
and conference papers using the terms “Discrete Event Simulation” with
Boolean logic “AND” with the terms: “Optimization”; “DEA”;
“Metaheuristic”; “Genetic”; “Tabu”; “Design of experiments”;
“Response surface”; “Metamodel”; “Parallel”.
Fig. 1 represents the early findings for the exploratory screening on
the selected databases, especially regarding the studies of Franceschini,
Maisano, and Mastrogiacomo (2014); Jahangirian et al. (2010). It describes four primary aspects that researchers or practitioners should
consider for DSBO projects. The design was thought to be both way and
iterative, where the researcher or practitioner can start from the desired
problem, choose the best DSBO method that he/her know it. Then, the
software and the hardware are chosen according to the resources
available. The analysis can be both way and iterative because, in the
early stage of the DSBO project, the optimization method selection is
conditioned to the resources available regarding software license,

computer power, and necessary knowledge, demanding time and
money for the acquisition and development.
The idea for the present paper emerged from the observed lack of
research that joins IE problems and DSBO in a wide range. It can help at
the initial step for such type of project, considering the state of the art in
terms of DSBO methodologies. The objectives of this research consist of:
(a) Develop an extensive systematic literature review on DSBO applications on IE;
(b) Identify and extract the methodologies found in these studies;
(c) Analyze and summarize the methodologies found;
(d) Discuss the assumptions according to the results.
To accomplish these objectives, Review Questions (RQ) were formulated to help in the extraction of valid data from the articles. The
Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (2009) define a frame to shape
the RQ regarding population, interventions, comparators, outcomes,
and if the research demands, study design. This method is known as
PICO, PICOS or PICOC (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Context) acronym, generally used as SLR in medical research.
Other frameworks for medicine were found in Booth, Papaioannou, and
Sutton (2012) such as SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type) (Methley, Campbell, Chew-Graham,
McNally, & Cheraghi-Sohi, 2014). According to Denyer, Tranfield, and
van Aken (2008), the data for organization and management studies
(including IE) is fragmented and need a specific framework. In that
context, the CIMO-logic is proposed to involve the problem Context that
needs a specific Intervention and use a Mechanism to generate Outcomes. Other studies (e.g., Costa, Soares, & De Sousa, 2016; Krause &
Schutte, 2016; Pilbeam, Alvarez, & Wilson, 2012; Rajwani & Liedong,
2015; Tanskanen et al., 2017) used the CIMO-logic to express the research questions. For the purpose of the present paper, the RQ used
were defined by the CIMO-logic question that is divided into four elements:
• Context: Which real or theoretical Industrial Engineering problems…
• Intervention: …use an optimization algorithm…
• Mechanism: …combined with discrete event simulation…
• Outcomes: …to find the best solution in terms of quality defined in
the prior objectives and project resources.
The Research Questions (RQs) were defined in order to describe
characteristics of each of the dimensions explored by the CIMO-logic,
with the “Mechanism” of discrete event simulation been a prerequisite:
• RQ1: Which are the main problems studied, related to the area of
Industrial Engineering (Context)?
• RQ2: Which optimization methods and implementation software
were the most used (Intervention)?
• RQ3: How the results were measured (Outcomes)?
• RQ4: Which author, university, publication year, and journal were
found that compose the reference research centers (Context)?
In order to answer the RQs, Fig. 2 summarizes the data collected in
the papers to couple with the objectives, forming the pillars for the
research.
Fig. 2 illustrates the three areas that were considered to the data
extraction from the articles. The first category is the nature of the research which define the problem category, the industrial sector and if
the project is based on the solution of a real problem or with data extracted from the literature. The second category represents the adopted
methods to perform the DSBO, comprising the optimization method,
the software used, and the results measurement. The last category
considers the available origin information, i.e., author's name, affiliation (university or company), country of origin, and journal data (name
and publication year).
3.2.2. Searching/screening
To avoid omitting pertinent citations (Franceschini et al., 2014), the
following 18 databases were selected with their own academic search
engines: ACM Digital Library; CiteSeerX; dblp Computer Science Bibliography; Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ); Emerald Insight;
Google Scholar; IEEE Xplore; Microsoft Academic Search; Portal Capes;
Research Gate; Sage Journals; Scielo; Science Direct; Scopus; Semantic
Scholar; Springer Link; Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library. The
databases were consulted at the same alphabetic order presented.
After the discussion for the exploratory search, the keywords
“Discrete Event Simulation” was selected with boolean logic (AND)
with: “Optimization”, “Metaheuristic”; “Genetic”; “VNS”; “GRASP”;
“Tabu”; “Particle swarm”; “Ant colony”; “Design of experiments”;
“Response surface”; “Factoria”l; “Metamodel”; “Model reduction”;
“Parallel”; and “GPU”, performing 15 searches for each of the 18 presented academic search engines, generating a total of 270 searches. The
search engine results are sorted by the criteria of relevance, meaning
that the result list presents at the first positions articles with all the
defined terms, and so on.
The study selection was conducted with an initial screening of titles
and abstracts regarding two requirements. First, if the article or conference paper (i) seems to be relevant; (ii) uses the English language;
(iii) was peer-reviewed; (iv) was published in the last 25 years; and (v)
has the full paper available. Second, a relevance criterion, i.e., the
screening’s stop criterion for each of the selected keyword combination
(more than 200 K in estimative). These screenings were stopped when
the position of the last selected article (according to the first requirement) was at least 20 positions above the current article under
screening. Table 1 summarizes the number of downloaded articles.
Table 1 presents the distribution of the total 663 (271 + 392, explained on Fig. 3) articles downloaded from 12 databases/search engines proposed, showing the result ranking the most probable databases
to find articles and conference papers related to DSBO. The result
presented is partly influenced by the fact that the consulting on the
databases was made on the same order presented in Table 1 and the
repeated names were discharged, what means that the last names
cannot be considered worse, for example, the Scopus can be better than
ACM because had 17 different than the first. The databases CiteSeerX,
Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, Portal Capes, Research
Gate, and Wiley Online Library does not return significant results to the
proposed research keyword combinations. Fig. 3 lists the process for the
selected articles.
Fig. 3 resumes the process of search and screening with the proposed keyword combination and selected databases. After using the

stop criteria and the screening, 793 articles were downloaded and 522
were excluded for one or more of the following reasons: 62 (15.86%)
were theoretical studies, 202 (51.66%) do not present an IE problem,
77 (19.69%) do not adopt discrete event simulation or use agent-based
approaches, 86 (21.99%) do not use a valid optimization method, 42
(10.74%) use only deterministic variables, and two (0.51%) were not
written in the English language. Moreover, 130 duplicates were excluded. To identify these repeated files, the 793 downloaded articles
were put together in the same folder where each file was labeled with
the article’s name and arranged in alphabetical order. This approach
was useful as each searched database has its way to label the files,
making difficult to identify the repeated ones. When two consecutive
files had the same name and archive size, they were evaluated for
possible duplicity.
Theoretical studies, excluded from the review, comprised articles
that only discuss a specific part of the simulation process (e.g.,
Adegoke, Togo, & Traore, 2013; Das, 2000; Thomas, Howes, & Luk,
2009) and do not present a case study or action research. Articles that
did not present an IE problem comprised studies in areas such as
software development, biological systems, and urban traffic (e.g.
Montagna, Viroli, & Roli, 2015; Muta, Raymond, Hara, & Morimura,
2015), but this depends on the application for such areas, for example,
maintenance area that can perform preventive, predictive, and corrective studies in which an Industrial Engineer will have little knowledge
to work, but related to maintenance workforce timetabling, an Industrial Engineer can perform a DSBO with collected data from the real
case.
3.2.3. Analysis/synthesis
The synthesis of the findings was performed using a Microsoft
Excel® spreadsheet to compile all the information extracted from the
271 articles. In order to answer the RQs, each selected article was
evaluated in the concern of 10 items: problem; case study; optimization
method, implementation software; results measurement; author’s name;
publication’s year; publication’s name; author’s affiliation and nationality, resuming the proposition illustrated in Fig. 2. After the data extraction, similar terms were identified and consolidated for a better
synthesis, for example, metamodel and metamodeling, or design of
experiments and factorial design.
After the synthesis of data according to the pillars presented in
Fig. 2, Excel® was used for descriptive statistics to determine the percentage of appearance for each type of problem, method, and research
origin. This data synthesis was the base for the SLR analysis that consisted of presenting the findings and best practices for the development
of DSBO on IE projects.
3.2.4. Presentation (Reporting)
The 271 articles were divided into two categories: journals and
proceedings of international conferences, comprising respectively 150
and 121 documents. To present the findings after the analysis and
synthesis process, Tables 2–5 and Figs. 4 and 5 summarize the data. The
results were presented on a sequence to answer the RQs, developing a
discussion by the authors to present the state-of-the-art techniques
applied to DSBO projects on IE problems, showing the past and present
practices and bringing up possibilities to the future of DSBO on IE.

4. Findings and discussion
In order to present the findings to answer the research questions, the
data gathered for the pillars of the research are presented in this section
to generate the basis for the discussion.
4.1. Nature of the research:
This section presents the findings related to the first pillar, i.e., the
“nature of the research”, which is related to the information of the
problem itself, the industrial sector and the definition if the project is
based on the solution of a real problem or with data extracted from the
literature. Table 2 summarizes the findings to answer the RQ1.
In problem type, five categories were generated according to the
significant number of articles related (at least 20): industrial process,
inventory control, scheduling, logistics, and not specified. Industrial
processes comprise problems that occur mainly on the shop floor of an
industry, where part of the value is generated. Such problems are related to parameter production definition (e.g., Al-Aomar & Al-Okaily,
2006; Can & Heavey, 2011; Choi, Seo, & Kim, 2014; Creighton &
Nahavandi, 2003), buffer (e.g., Amiri & Mohtashami, 2012; Costa,
Alfieri, Matta, & Fichera, 2015), inspection (e.g., Van Volsem, Dullaert,
& Van Landeghem, 2007), and resource allocation (e.g., Lucidi,
Maurici, Paulon, Rinaldi, & Roma, 2016). The sum of the papers is
higher than the original quantity (275 > 270) because articles presented more than one problem related to IE (e.g., Can & Heavey, 2012).
The other types of problems are related to production support systems,
mainly with respect to inventory control (e.g. Kilmer, Smith, & Shuman,
1999) for stock level and replenishment; scheduling associated to programming job shop and dispatching (e.g. Costa, 2015; Jia, Bard,
Chacon, & Stuber, 2015; Martins, Fuchs, Pando, Lüders, & Delgado,
2013; Naderi, Khalili, & Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, 2009; Neto &
Goncalves, 2010; Saadouli, Jerbi, Dammak, Masmoudi, & Bouaziz,
2015); logistics (e.g. Baril, Gascon, & Cartier, 2014; Zhen, Wang, Hu, &
Chang, 2014) for allocation, location, layout, supply, and routing problems; or not specified studies (e.g. Kilmer et al., 1999) which cannot be
determined in one of the previews categories.
The four primary problems namely scheduling, industrial process,
logistics, and inventory control represent 94.2% of the total problems.
This is a sign that these areas have IID aleatory variables that constitute
a search space which demand a sophisticated methodology, such as

present SLR does not try to search for other methodologies to evaluate
such problems but is possible to infer that in these cases DSBO is a
viable tool to be considered and used. The size of the presented problems was in general composed by few stations and/or buffers (1–5),
representing only part of the total production systems, showing that
DSBO was planned to resolve part of a specific problem, and not to
evaluate the role system. Even this problem size has a search space that
justifies the use of optimization methods.
For the economic sector, the four categories were: primary, related
to the production or exploitation of natural resources; secondary, that is
responsible for the transformation of natural resources in goods; tertiary, associated to the provision of services; and not specified, when
the object of study cannot be detailed in one of the other categories. As
expected, the same production system can have either a perspective to
supply the customer with goods and services. In this case, only the
primary purpose of the problem was considered. In this context, a job
shop scheduling and supply chain problem related to the automotive
industry would be associated with the secondary economic sector, if the
main objective is the production and provision of a good.
Only two papers were identified in the primary sector
(Nageshwaraniyer, Son, & Dessureault, 2013a, 2013b), related to a coal
mine. These studies were performed by the same authors, two from the
Industrial Engineering and the other one from the Geological Engineering. This may be explained by the fact that DSBO problems are
mainly studied on specific engineering courses such as Industrial, Mechanical, Electrical, and Computer. Other courses like Agronomy,
Zootechny and Mining Engineering have a different focus and can be

dependent on the knowledge from the four courses presented before.
This suggests that the primary sector can be explored by future studies
with the collaboration between the presented courses. The secondary
and tertiary sector comprised most of the studies, 58.9%, and 30.2%,
respectively. This unbalance between the secondary and tertiary can be
an evidence that the production of goods is more suitable to be modeled
by DES methods, due to the fact that the production of a service is more
dependent to the iteration between customer and provider, that have
human and cultural characteristics that are difficult to be modeled by
DES and can be a field to be explored by agent-based simulation
methodology (Dorigatti, Guarnaschelli, Chiotti, & Salomone, 2016).
The third aspect presented by Table 2 is the production sector.
Problems related with the semiconductor, healthcare, automotive, and
chemical industries represented 25.1% of the total. These industries are
related to the secondary and tertiary economic sectors and commonly
produce goods and services with a high level of aggregate value,
compared to the primary sector industries. The category others refer to
a sparse variety of industries that represent 10.5% of the total, and for
64.4% of the articles, it was not possible to specify the production
sector. The fact that the article does not specify the related production
sector may be explained by the frequent discretion and confidentiality
adopted to hide the company problem or strategic information. In this
sense, it is recommended that future works specify the object that
generated the problem, helping practitioners and researchers to find
already implemented solutions for similar problems, and to choose
suitable methods. This issue was seen both on journal and proceeding
papers.
The last information presented in Table 2 is the origin of the data
used on the examples presented in the articles. Theoretical articles
comprise papers that used data from other studies, mainly not developed by the same authors, or used classical problems presented in books
or specialized literature. In this matter, it is shown a relative balance
between the number of publications in both directions, on paper and
proceedings. This may indicate that the development of DSBO has been
made both on the theoretical and practical ways.
According to the data presented in Table 2 and the corresponding
discussion, it is possible to answer the RQ1 (“which are the main problems studied, related to the area of Industrial Engineering?”): the industrial sectors responsible for the productions of goods and services
with high aggregated value respond for the projects that most invested
in modeling and searching for the optimized solution of the presented
problems, mainly due to the significant costs and benefits related to
scheduling, industrial process, logistics, and inventory control processes.
4.2. Adopted method
In order to search a solution space, looking for the best feasible
solution, a variety of optimization methods can be applied to a DES
problem. Table 3 summarizes the methods found to optimize the problems presented in Section 4.1, and adopted by at least five articles.
Frequently, articles used more than one optimization method in the
same article, justifying the total of 571 methods and implementations.
Another factor is that one method/article can use a mix of two different
modeling types such as integer or binary programming (e.g., Saremi,
Jula, Elmekkawy, & Wang, 2013). In those cases, two methods were
considered.
According to Table 3, 40% of the used heuristics are related to
Local, Random and Hill Climbing search methods, and the remaining
60% are related to specific algorithms that do not fit on the first 3 ones,
for example multi-start (Lamiri, Grimaud, & Xie, 2009), or do not describe the adopted heuristic. This fact is partially explained by the
nature of the heuristic search method that explores a specific problem
characteristic. Although it is possible to use a generic method, e.g., the
Hill Climb (Raska & Ulrych, 2015), the application of the heuristics
requires adapting the search algorithm for the specific characteristic of
the studied problem.
Related to the metaheuristics, 43.1% are derived from evolutionary
algorithms with different denominations, for example, differential
evolution, chaotic differential evolution, genetic algorithm, evolutionary algorithm, and NSGA II. These are mainly population search
methods with some modification of the genetic algorithm concepts for
the individual, gene, population, crossover, etc. The sum of the second,
third and fourth most used metaheuristics (simulated annealing, tabu,
and Variable Neighborhood Search – VNS) represent 16.9% of the total,
compared to the 43.1% of the evolutionary. From all the 554 DSBO
methods applied, the 290 metaheuristics represent 52.3%, and the 125
evolutionary represent 22.6%. The line “other” represents 116 methods
(40.0% of the metaheuristics) combining methods such as artificial
immune algorithm, scatter search, GRASP, particle swarm, and ant
colony.
The surrogate model represents the second most used DSBO
method, corresponding to 110 methods (19.9% of the total). The most
used surrogate method was the Design of Experiments (DOE) (30.9% of
the surrogate methods) followed by response surface (17.3%). The DOE
method itself provides, in general, a non-linear regression that cannot
provide a good solution alone, but together with other optimization
methods such response surface. By this means, all the surrogate
methods use in some phase a metamodel to be optimized, and in some
cases, the articles make explicit or not the use of them. The line DOE
refers to all DOE methods found such as hypercube, full factorial,
Taguchi, robust design, and LHD. The regression is related to more
specific methods, for example, time-series, and the Kriging methods
comprise, for example, kriging metamodeling, detrended kriging, and
studentized.
For DSBO, the standard framework presented on the papers is to use
a computer that uses a single instruction sequential algorithm in the
form of proprietary software or algorithm to generate the DES model
and evaluate the search space. On 28 studies (4.8% of the total), the
implementation of specific problems used single machines and parallel
instructions or multiple machines with distributed instructions. In that
way, two types of parallelism were found, related to the use of only CPU
(Central Processing Unit) on single or distributed machines or hybrid
algorithms that use both the CPU and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
to parallelize the processing of some instruction on the simulation.
From the 28 original articles, 23 (82.1%) used the parallelization with
the CPU, and five (17.9%) used the GPU together with the CPU, with
the earliest publication in 2010 (Park & Fishwick, 2010), which may
indicate this as a trending topic for DSBO. The parallelization of the
simulation alone does not characterize as an optimization method. For
that, it is possible to combine other methods (e.g., heuristics and metaheuristics) to search for a good solution on a viable period of time
(Costa et al., 2015; Mokhtari & Salmasnia, 2015; Sailer et al., 2013;
Uhlig & Rose, 2011).
The fifth criteria refer to the use of proprietary optimization programs, for example, OptQuest® and SimRunner®. The use of proprietary
optimization software, by the academic point of view, has limitations
that compromise the development and test of new optimization
methods that can present contributions to the refereed literature. This is
one reason that contributed to the few numbers of papers (21 articles)
that utilized proprietary optimization software as the main optimization software or a comparison point to relate with other methods.
The methods related to Monte Carlo and Gradient-Based represent
2.6% of the total (15 times used). The category “Other” refers to
methods that were used less than five times (47 times used, 8.2% of the
total) for example, model reduction, decision tree, cloning, and fuzzy.
The small number of publications, for the methods presented on the
Other category, can be a sign for the need of development on these
optimization areas, according to the success of implementation presented on the articles. Table 4 present the software used and DSBO
variables considered on the papers.
According to Table 4, the criterium “software” presents the
W. Trigueiro de Sousa Junior et al. Computers & Industrial Engineering 128 (2019) 526–540
533
programs used for DSBO. The most adopted software is the DES
modeler Arena®, used on 51 articles (11.9% from the total). The second
category “Not specified” represent the articles that used computer
programing language but does not specify which one, cited on 45 articles (10.5%). The third most cited software is the Matlab® that could
be either used for modeling or optimization, on 39 articles (9.1%). The
three most used software bring on sight the problem related to all DSBO
studies that are the generation of the DES computer model and the
recursive call for the evaluation of the results by an optimization
method and the parameters to call the new scenarios.
Thinking on this question, the second criterium “DES/
Optimization/Communication” separate on three categories according
to the purpose of the software. The first “Programming language” join
all the articles that cited, directly or not directly, the used programs or
computer programing languages that demand programming skills such
as C++, C#, Java, Cplex, VBA, and CUDA, generating a total of 169
(39.3%) programs. The second category “Modeler and optimizer” is
related to the cited software that can be used for both model and optimization, for example, Matlab®, representing 36.0% of the mentioned
software. The last category refers for the commercial DES software used
for modeling only, for example, Arena®, ProModel®, Witness®,
ExtendSim®, AnyLogic®, and Enterprise Dinamics®, referring to 106
cited software (24.7%).
Analyzing the two first criteria on Table 4, it is possible to infer that
there is no consent on the academic and practitioner communities to
define a framework capable of joining the modeling phase and optimization on DSBO projects. Considering that it is not a common practice to use more than one DES software, it can be said that at least 106
articles (39.1%) from the 271 analyzed, used a commercial program to
model the DES, and the majority of the studies in some part used a
programing language, except the four articles that used commercial
optimization programs only (e.g., OptQuest® and SimRunner®). The
scatter variety for possible combinations of DSBO methodologies and
adopted “test beds” make challenging to replicate the studies or to
compare the results of an optimization method. For the development of
a DSBO framework capable of creating a DES model and an open environment to test different search optimizations, the works of Freitag
and Hildebrandt (2016) and Hildebrandt, Goswami, & Freitag (2015)
can be cited.
According to the data presented in Table 4 and the corresponding
discussion, it is possible to answer the RQ2 (“which optimization and
implementation software methods were the most used?”: in the computer modeling phase, in almost half the cases, a commercial DES
software was used, and for the optimization, a programing language
was adopted, implementing in most of the cases a metaheuristic or
surrogate model analysis.
The last category in Table 4 is related to the key performance indicators that constituted the variables for the objective function and the
constraints that limit the search space, separated on four criteria. The
benchmark studies are related to theoretical papers with the study case
that used data from the literature (books and specialized articles) or
compared the author results with commercial optimization programs,
responsible for 22 variables, 5.2% of the total studies. The “Maximization of throughput” comprise the objectives related to process
times that influence on the production parameters, for example, queue
length, production rate, flow time, wait time, lead time, product
throughput, and makespan, corresponding for 125 variables (29.7%).
The “Minimization of cost” relate the variables that have direct influence on production costs such as payroll, revenue, performance, efficiency, net profit, capital, resources, cost savings, WIP, lot size, stock
level, buffer size, batch size, and customer demand, showing on 181
variables, 43.0% of the total. “Speedup” is related to the time or
number of iterations needed to find good solutions, present on 42
variables, 10.0% of the total. As it is not common to have more than one
speedup variable on the same articles, it is possible to infer that 42
works, 15.5% from the 271 papers, used the speed up as a
measurement. The criteria “Other” is related to statistical measures
between results such as Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE).
It was observed that the results measurement was made to correlate
at least one maximization of throughput and one minimization of cost
criteria on the objectives and/or restrictions. This is expected to the
formulation of the optimization problem with a finite and defined space
solution, with inverse related variables that at some point have a region
that maximizes or minimize the problem response. It was not clear if
the best result presented was implemented on the real systems nor how
far it was from the probable global optimum. According to the authors,
part of this issue can be explained by the fact that the stochastic nature
of the DES variables makes challenging to guarantee that a good solution found can be used and generate a similar result than the simulated
one. This mater can be more explored in future works.
Considering the RQ3 (“how the results were measured?”), it is
possible to infer that the measurement of the DSBO projects is related to
the initial purpose which stimulates the development of the same. For a
general DSBO project on IE, the reasons were related to the need for
evaluation of multiple scenarios that influence the way the organization
works and the revenue, when a manual simulation is prohibitive.
Therefore, the measurement considers how good a solution is and the
time needed for the optimization get on it.
According to Chwif, Paul, and Barretto (2006), optimization
methods and procedures applied to DES can be classified in four categories: gradient-based search, stochastic approximations, response
surface methodology, and heuristic search methods. This categorization
was made in 1999 and was not the purpose of the article to make a
more precise definition of DSBO methods. For Juan et al. (2015), it
considered the ranking and selection, black-box search methods, metamodel, gradient-based methods, sample path, and stochastic constraints
and multi-objective. Fig. 4 summarizes the findings related to the
methodologies applied to DSBO on IE problems, that extend the proposed classification of the aforementioned authors.
Fig. 4 illustrates the best practices for DSBO on IE found in the
present study to help on the planning for the steps of a DSBO project on
IE, based on the 271 articles. The first step is to define the problem and
the questions that will be answered by the DSBO. If the search space or
the problem can be limited in a small number of scenarios, intuitive
methods can be used to determine the number of manual changes
needed on the simulation model, escaping from the scope of the present
work, that evaluated problems that have a search space that is prohibitive to be made manually, only with the help of a computer optimization method. After the evaluation of the problem and the need for an
automatic search method, it is possible to evaluate the software required for the computer model and optimization.
The second step constitutes to evaluate the available resources of
time and knowledge to spent on the construction and finding the optimal solution. This constitutes an essential issue because more complex
simulation systems involving distributed/parallel simulation demand
more time and equipment investment that are not an assurance to find a
better solution than sequential programming but increases the probability. The last step is to determine the optimization method(s) applied
to the simulation model. The selection of the method can be related to
the findings of previous works or by the implementation and comparison of different methods, according to the available resources. At this
point, there is not a consensus for what method is more suitable to solve
the problem, depending on the previous knowledge and experience of
the simulation team.
4.3. Origin of the research
The origin of the research summarizes the data collected on the 271
articles that refer to the context of the authors and where they produced
the articles related to DSBO on IE, to help in the answer of RQ 4. It is an
interest in the present study to find if there is a correlation between the
W. Trigueiro de Sousa Junior et al. Computers & Industrial Engineering 128 (2019) 526–540
534
authors and their different nationality to construct a research community in the area of DSBO. Table 5 present the findings.
From the total of 789 names found on all articles, 126 appear more
than one time, and a total of 663 names without repetition were found.
In the top 10 ranking for the authors, the difference from the most
productive author to the others is no more than two articles, which
shows a panorama that the authors do not have a continuous production on the field of DSBO applied to IE problems, with a sparse domain
of this knowledge. This effect demands a search for different authors in
order to find more details on a specific optimization methodology or
related problem.
The second information on Table 5 is related to the affiliation of the
authors. With a similar understanding from the previous conclusion, the
Universities where the studies were conducted does not show a significant number of publications that justify a cluster or reference research center related exclusively to DSBO on IE. The last information on
Table 5 join the articles according to the author’s country affiliation. At
this point is possible to make data segregation, according to Fig. 5.
According to the graphic presented on Fig. 5, is possible to elect the
USA, Germany, China, Canada, Brazil, Iran, UK, France, Italy, and
Ireland, the top 10 countries that concentrate the most productive authors, but with the second information conclusion, even in these
countries, the development of DSBO on IE does not have a reference
center. Another relevant information extracted from the articles is how
the optimization projects have been developed, with the collaboration
of multiple research centers from different universities, private sector
institutions, and countries. Table 6 present the data collected for the
author's team.
The data on Table 6 is related to the different origins and configurations for the author's team of each article. For the first information is
possible to infer that in 29.2% of the works, members of two or more
universities were involved. The second information is related to the
involvement of private and public institution members, different from
an academic organization, responsible for 19.9%. This issue signs the
interaction between academics and the industrial sector or governmental institutions. The third data correlates authors that have institutional affiliation in different countries, comprising 12.2% of the
works. For the remaining of the publications, 38.7%, the authors are
from the same academic institution.
The 271 articles were published by 62 journals and 45 conferences.
Table 7 related the top 10 publication journals and proceedings found
for DSBO on IE.
According to Table 7, the first five journals represent 62 published
articles for DSBO on IE, comprising 41.4% of the publications. The
other five listed journals published 25 articles (9.2%). Regarding the
conference proceedings, the Winter Simulation Conference (WSC) alone
represents 57.0% of all articles, showing that the WSC is a reference for
the researches and practices on DSBO applied to IE. Fig. 6 illustrates the
publishing of DSBO on IE along the 25 years considered for the present
research.
According to Fig. 6, it is possible to infer that from 1991 to 2008
there was a trend of growth and mature of the concepts and
applications of DSBO on IE. This could be partially explained by the
evolution of the Queue Theory and accessibility to computers and DES
software. From 2014 to 2016, a decline of 48.5% on the publication is
noticed, but the reasons are not clear. Moreover, in the same period, the
agent-based modeling gained strength and researchers and practitioners
may have concentrated efforts to study hybrid systems or different
kinds of simulation that can be characterized as an increase or maintenance of the research produced volume in the area of simulation as a
whole. Nevertheless, a more extended period and more data are necessary for conclusive evidence.
Finishing with the RQ4 (“which author, university, publication year
and journal were found that compose the reference research centers?”),
it is not possible to infer with the information on Tables 5–7 and Fig. 6
that exist a reference research center which concentrates the publication on DSBO on IE. Furthermore, the collected data indicates a scarce
orientation to identify a location for research some specific type of
optimization method and IE problems relating to discrete event simulation.
4.4. Future research directions on DSBO
According to the papers and proceedings evaluated in the present
study, three major optimization techniques showed vast improvement
and still in development. The first two are related to the use of metaheuristics and machine learning optimization algorithms, and the last
method with hardware parallelization.
To search in an NP-hard problem with a scatter solution space,
metaheuristics can perform well in terms of finding local or near global
optimum solutions in a reasonable wall clock time. If the discrete event
simulation is needed, surrogate models (or metamodels) methods can
be used instead of the real simulation. The metamodels are, in general,
a mathematical representation that gives a result similar to the real
simulation, in an amount of time less than the needed to run the simulation. For example, it is possible to cite the use of the Decision Trees
machine learning method and the metaheuristic Tabu Search for dispatching rules (Shahzad & Mebarki, 2016).
The idea of machine learning and metaheuristic is found in more
recent papers, using Artificial Immune Systems and Genetic Algorithm
in a material handling system (Leung & Lau, 2018). The NSGA-II and
SPEA2 evolutionary algorithms were used to select optimal Information
Technology Infrastructure Library (Ruiz, Moreno, Dorronsoro, &
Rodriguez, 2018), and the use of decomposition-based multi-objective
differential evolution algorithm (MODE/D) compared against NSGA-II
for inventory replenishment problem (Avci & Selim, 2018). Integrating
with the trends on the era of Industry 4.0, machine learning is a tool
that has been used for a variety of manufacturing prediction issues
(Diez-Olivan, Del Ser, Galar, & Sierra, 2018).
The third method is the use of hardware parallelism. Along with
algorithm development, modern computers have increased their computation power, in particular, the capacity of processing more than one
instruction at a time with the advent of multi-core processors, in which
discrete event simulation can be benefited (Jafer et al., 2013). A recent
research used NSGA-II and parallelism on bridge construction projects
with the time to find the solution of the problem characteristics (Salimi,
Mawlana, & Hammad, 2018). Fig. 7 illustrates the progress of the
publication related to the categories of optimization methods classified
according to Table 3. In recent years, articles that adopt hardware
parallelism present more consistent participation in the DSBO studies
on IE, also indicating a research direction.
The three cited methods metaheuristics, metamodel using machine
learning, and parallel processing have in common the need to find good
solutions in the least amount of available time. This issue reflects the
crescent need to process a large amount of stochastic data and the
benefit from the developments on optimization algorithms and hardware parallelization. According to Fig. 7, in the last 25 years, these
three methods represented 64% of all the produced research on the area

of DSBO applied to IE, and, considering the last five years (2012–2016),
the methods were used on 68% of the studies. Other related issues for
future works are the trends for problem types. Fig. 8 relates the topics
presented in Table 2 for the considered period of time.
Observing the information on Fig. 8, the problem types are 68%
related to scheduling and industrial process, composing the majority of
the studied problems. Evaluating the development through the years,
the presented problems have a historic mark between the years 2000
and 2002, beginning an exponential growth. The development can be
explained by the ease of computer power access generated on these
years, related to the acquisition and development of computer hardware and programs for simulation. After the year 2000, the use of DSBO
on IE have a consist increase and can be considered an established
practice on the problem types presented in Fig. 8.
The less researched optimization methods and areas, presented in
Figs. 7 and 8, are not characterized as inapt but with a few numbers of
studies. The aptitude can be an issue to be evaluated in future studies,
aiming to determine which methods and areas are best suited to be used
with DSBO projects on IE. For example, healthcare is a growing study
area where simulation projects have been developed.
5. Conclusions and findings
The purpose of the present study was never to cover all the existing
articles about the theme, but to analyze a significant sample size to give
insights about the past and present practices about DSBO on IE, helping
researchers and practitioners with the presentation of the already existing projects for future ones. Given the proposed SLR structure and
presented methodology, the coverage of the literature about DSBO on
IE was considered enough to answer the RQs with a satisfactory understanding of the subject. It is worth the recommendation for future
researchers and practitioners, especially those who seek to enter a Ph.D.
program, to understand and adapt the SLR methodology to evaluate
new topics and trends on the corresponding knowledge, especially
proven by the present work, on the field of Industrial Engineering.
Thinking on the seek to answer the RQs, the first conclusion is that
the problems related to the production of goods and services studied on
DSBO are related to the optimization of resource mainly related to

operators, machine and resources, which represent the majority of the
production costs and are always in the aim of the administrators to be
changed and optimized. The second conclusion refers to the optimization method and implementation software, which is an area with no
consensus because the same problem can be solved by more than one
way, and it was not seen a framework that could be applied to all
problems without a good prior knowledge of the researcher or practitioner, being one point to be considered on the development of the
project. For the optimization of resources, the time spent to generate
the solution and the cost of initial and final obtained solutions were
compared, and in general, the results are presented as suitable. The last
conclusion presents the authors and locations where the DSBO on IE
were developed. There is no cluster or important research center that is
a reference on this area, but the amount of data shows a sparse use on
46 countries all over the world with good results.
Regarding the answer of the RQs, some issues were observed on the
related works that worth mention to direct future studies:
• The selected articles do not present the initial resources necessary
and if they were considered at any moment during the project. It is
only familiar to talk briefly about the computer hardware and
software specifications that were used. The DSBO was not considered, in overall, a project in terms for the management of time,
identification and selection of possible knowledge necessary to
achieve a goal and the application of other resources, with specific
results for each project step. That is a literature deficiency that can
be considered for future works. Even at the papers that show a DES
methodology, it was common that some part of the project was not
described and discussed (e.g., verification and validation). In the
analyzed articles, it was not found the time dedicated to the project
nor part of it, or the number of people necessary and in which activities they worked;
• It was common to focus on the optimization methods and a way to
compare the results. Although this is beneficial information, for
future researches or practitioners that will read the article, it is
valuable to indicate why other methods were not considered and the
mistakes made during this phase. That is a way to avoid the same
mistakes or to make clearer the science development steps performed;
• The pulverized register of the works produced on the field of DSBO
on IE is a sign that this field stays in the interest of many people,
with few final rules about the best way to treat some problem. Most
of it as a result from the essence of the DSBO that put together
problems that always will reflect the new challenges of the industries and the optimization methods that follow and put together
the discovery on areas such as combinatorial problems and 0

computer technological advances;
• There is a demand on the DSBO on IE to the development of programs that put together modeling and optimization, in a way that
the decision agent can test and implement different kinds of optimization. This can be a sign to the development of research projects
between IE and Information Technology to develop such software to
be friendly to the final user and speed up DSBO projects with different methods;
• The studies selected do not present if the best solutions were used or
not, even in the real study cases, coupling if the best solution generated the simulated advantages proposed and how close they are
from reality, as a final test to prove that the DSBO was efficient as
the initial proposal;
• There are few articles (19.9% of the total cases) where the name of a
company appears together with the list of authors, showing little
interaction, related to real cases. That can be a bad sign that companies were not entirely involved during the process of the DSBO
project, showing that in the future the enterprise could not use and
improve the DSBO;
• The comparison of the optimization scenarios is made comparing
one specific method against each other. That compromise the generalization of results to that specific case. More robust optimization
framework can be proposed to test and solve a more significant
number of different problems;
• On the 271 selected articles, a general summary was not found that
consider together the aspects for problems on IE, optimization
methods, and software/ hardware, in the first phase, for the conceptual part of the DSBO project, the think about the resources
available and needed to develop or to search for already implemented ones, due to the variety of methods and software’s already existed in the market;
It is known that academic papers tend to present, using the scientific
method, how a proposed change in the current state of knowledge can
lead to a significant improvement on the initial analyzed results. The
ideas presented above do not criticize but try to enrich the discussion in
a way that industrial organizations and overall interested people have
more information that can be determinant on the success on the implementation of a DSBO on IE project.
